Java version of the perl libraries.
===================================
This work was done by Ozzy Espaillat (ozzy@unwiredsolutions.com).
It has been released under the LGPL by Ozzy.

Ozzy has supplied to us two files:
ctport_bin.jar
CTPort.src.jar 

One is a binary jar, to run just type:

java -cp ctport_bin.jar com.us.ctserver.test.PlayRec <host> <port>

where host is most likely localhost and port is most likely 1200.

The other is the source jar, which contains the libraries and the application.
